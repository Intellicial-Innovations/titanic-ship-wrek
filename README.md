Well, extensively, Titanic doesnâ€™t need an introduction as everyone on this planet is aware of the ship (thanks to James Cameron), but we still need to understand about the dataset recorded and all the information it is giving to us.

> On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.

>One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class passengers.

Algorithems that we will be using are:

> Logistic Regression
>> Decission Tree Classifier
>>> Random Forest Classifier
